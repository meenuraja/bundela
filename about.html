    <p>Hi! I'm <strong>Meenu</strong>, born on <strong>1st August 2003</strong> and originally from the beautiful town of <strong>Lalitpur, Uttar Pradesh</strong>. I'm currently pursuing <strong>Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA)</strong> at <strong>LNCT University, Bhopal</strong>.</p>

    <p>Ever since I was a child, cooking has been my happy place. Watching my family cook and experimenting with ingredients in the kitchen sparked a passion that only grew stronger with time. Today, that passion has taken shape in the form of this website — my small digital cookbook, made with love. ❤️</p>

    <p>This website is a collection of hand-picked recipes ranging from <strong>traditional Indian sweets</strong> like <em>Gulab Jamun</em> and <em>Rasgulla</em>, to flavorful <strong>vegetable dishes</strong> like <em>Paneer Butter Masala</em> and <em>Baingan Bharta</em>. You’ll also find healthy <strong>salads</strong>, refreshing <strong>juices</strong>, and homemade <strong>parathas</strong> — perfect for every kind of foodie, whether you're a beginner or a seasoned cook.</p>

    <p>The goal of this website is simple: to make cooking fun, accessible, and delicious for everyone. Each recipe is explained in an easy way with basic ingredients so that even if you are new in the kitchen, you’ll feel confident to try them out. 😊</p>

    <p>Thank you for stopping by and being a part of my cooking journey. I hope my love for food inspires you to try something new today. Happy Cooking! 🍽️</p>

    <H2> Thank You 🙏🏻</H2>
